"""Invoice data model.

In order to make existing invoices independent of later changes/deletions of article and customer
data, each invoice copies the required fields, as part of the derived "Invoiced*" classes. The user
will still have the feeling of selecting customers and articles from the existing lists, but
internally the incoice is decoupled from the entities after copying.
