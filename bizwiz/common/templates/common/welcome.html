                Bizwiz is a small and simple invoicing and customer management platform for the
                aspiring photographer.

                With the official start of the photography business at
                http://www.bpfotografie.de/, Bizwiz started in early 2007 as a Windows
                forms application based on the .NET framework. The first version used in production
                was Bizwiz 2 and was written in C# and used MSSQL as a server backend.

            {% blocktrans %}
                After production use until end of 2016, Bizwiz was fully rewritten as a Django web
                application, utilizing Python as well as the typical web languages. Bizwiz is still
                a server-rendered (classic) web application, as it is truly data-driven and the
                classic render-edit-post cycle applies very well. In addition, learning the classic
                Django framework was also an objective of the project. Today, Bizwiz is running
                within a Docker container on virtually any platform.
